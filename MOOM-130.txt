The spacecraft shall support a calibration mode, involving the
execution of multiple calibrations in order to establish the angles
between a stellar reference and the instruments lines of sight such
that the pointing requirements can be met at all possible spacecraft
attitudes satisfying the attitude constraints of Section 4.2.7. and for all
possible spacecraft operational conditions.
