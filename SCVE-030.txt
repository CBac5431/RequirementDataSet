SCVE-030
H/P
The FEM’s shall be correlated against the results of the modal survey
tests carried out at component, subassembly and complete spacecraft
level. As a result of that, the following criteria shall be satisfied:
• for the modes with an effective mass greater than 10% of the total
mass
- frequency deviation less than 3%
- error for damping factor less than 20%
- Modal Assurance Criterium (MAC) greater than 0.9
• for the modes with an effective mass greater than 5% of the total
mass and an eigenfrequency below 100 Hz:
- eigenfrequency deviation less than 5%
- MAC greater than 0.9
