SENV-155
H/P
The spacecraft design and component selection shall take these
effects into account and shall ensure that these effects do not cause a
degraded performance or hazardous situations, which could lead to
loss of mission.
The spacecraft shall withstand without being disturbed, the following
levels:
- For Conducted Electrostatic Discharge (current injected anywhere
in the structure):
	- Energy: 15 mJ
	- Voltage: 15 kV (may be reduced to 4 kV if risk for is apparent)
- For Radiated Electrostatic Discharge (spark gap at 30 cm distance)
	- Energy: 15 mJ
	- Voltage: 15 kV
