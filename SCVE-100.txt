H/P
Detailed Thermal Mathematical Models ( DTMM ) and Detailed
Geometrical Mathematical Models ( DGMM ) of the spacecraft shall be
created for analytical predictions representative of all the phases of
the mission, including ground tests. Parametrical modelling approach
is recommended to ease follow up of design evolution.
