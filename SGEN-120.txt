SGEN-120
H/P
Materials shall have high resistance to stress corrosion cracking
(SCC) for all structural applications but also for applications (like
pretensioned springs or welded constructions which frequently include
residual internal and assembly stresses) in which the materials are
exposed for extended periods of time to tensile stresses in the
terrestrial atmosphere or potentially corrosive environments. The
requirement also applies for GSE handling and lifting devices for loads
higher than 30 kg.
Adequate resistance to SCC shall be verified in agreement with AD6-
16.
