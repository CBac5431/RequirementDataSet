SCMD-105
H/P
The alignment stability of the spacecraft shall be commensurate with
all spacecraft performance requirements (pointing, optical) and the
following causes of misalignments shall be taken into account:
- Setting due to mounting procedures
- Setting due to launch distortions
- Gravity release
- Deformations caused by orbital temperature variation over the
complete mission (including initial cooldown)
- Ageing
- Creep
- Composite structure deformations due to moisture release and
radiation.
