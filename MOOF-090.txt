For slews smaller than 16 arcmin, during any of the observational
pointing modes, the total time between initiation of the slew and the
moment when the telescope axis has achieved the pointing
requirements, as defined in paragraph 4.3.2.1, on the new target shall
be less than:
Requirement 10+SQRT (2*φ) seconds
goal 5 + SQRT(φ) seconds
φ being the slew angle in arcseconds.
