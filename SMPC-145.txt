SMPC-145
H/P
The subsystem shall be designed such that in all operating modes
where the power available from the solar array exceeds the main bus
and battery charge demand, the surplus electrical power is left in the
solar array. Large circulating currents between the solar array and the
spacecraft shall be avoided.
