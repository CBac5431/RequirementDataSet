SGEN-090
H/P
Materials which are not used inside pressurised volumes on the
spacecraft shall have low outgassing properties as determined by test
method according to AD6-13:
- Total Mass Loss (TML) < 1%
- Collected Volatile Condensable Material (CVCM) < 0.1%
In case of materials used in the vicinity of critical (optical) elements,
the more stringent requirement applies:
- TML < 0.10%
- CVCM < 0.01 %
