H
The Herschel S/C coordinate system (OHSC, XHSC, YHSC, ZHSC) is
defined as follows:
- the origin OHSC is at the centre of the Herschel/Launcher separation
plane.
- the XHSC-axis is normal to the Herschel/Launcher separation plane,
positive towards the payload.
- the ZHSC-axis is normal to the X-axis such that nominally Z is pointing
positive towards the sun.
- the YHSC-axis completes the right handed system.
