H/P
Windings shall be designed and tested to withstand a high voltage of
500 V DC / 1 min (for operating voltage up to 50 V) and 1500 V DC
(for higher operating voltage), applied between each other or between
windings and the structure for a period of time of at least two minutes
without causing disruptive charges.
