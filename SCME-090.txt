Mechanisms shall be capable of being tested representatively on
ground and of being operated in an ambient environment. However, if
required, flushing with inert gas may be designed to protect parts of
the mechanism, which are sensitive to operation in air due to the
presence of moisture, particles or other sources of contamination.
