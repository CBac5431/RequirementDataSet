P
The Amplitude Spectral Density ( ASD ) at the bolometer ( HFI ) or
cold LNA ( LFI ) of any signal due to fluctuating thermal emission from
a S/C element that couples radiatively into payload detectors , shall be
as specified below for each of the five defined individual frequencies ,
taking into account the power transfer function between the radiating
source and the detectors .
