SCMD-080
H/P
The total spacecraft mass shall be minimised wherever reasonable
and shall include, at the beginning of the Phase B, a margin on each
spacecraft elements depending on the development status of those
elements as follows :
- Completely new developments 20%
- new developments derived from existing hardware 15%
- existing units requiring minor/medium modification
or units passed PDR 10%
- existing units or units passed CDR 5%
The propellant masses shall be determined on the basis of dry mass
including the above contingencies and shall itself include the lifetime
margins (section 5.3.1).
- launcher dispersion compensation propellant 5%
- orbit insertion propellant 0%
- orbit maintenance propellant 50%
- angular momentum management/attitude control 50%
