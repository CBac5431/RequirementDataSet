The Planck S/C coordinate system (OPSC, XPSC, YPSC, ZPSC) is defined
as follows:
- the origin OPSC is in the centre of the Planck/Launcher separation
plane.
- the XPSC-axis is normal to the Planck/Launcher separation plane,
positive towards the payload.
- the ZPSC-axis is normal to the X-axis, in the symmetry plane of the
telescope, with the positive direction on the concave side of the
telescope.
- the YPSC:-axis completes the right handed system.
