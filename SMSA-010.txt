The solar array performance shall be predicted and the performance
figures shall include all effects which have an impact on this
performance (solar attitude, Sun intensity and variations thereof, cell
temperature, radiation, micro-meteorites, etc.) and shall be based on
accepted cell degradation figures and actual cell performance
measurements.
