SGEN-100 
H/P
Materials and combinations of materials bonded to each other shall be
resistant to the thermal cycling to which they will be exposed until the
end of the mission. A standard thermal cycling method is defined in
AD6-14, but the contractor shall as necessary perform specific thermal
cycling tests which are representative of the actual qualification
temperatures for the application, for qualification with at least a factor
1.5 on the number of cycles expected until end of the nominal lifetime
(minimum 10 cycles).
