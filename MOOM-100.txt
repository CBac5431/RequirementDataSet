The spacecraft shall support a calibration mode, involving the
execution of multiple calibrations in order to establish the angles
between stellar reference and the instruments lines of sight such that
the pointing requirements of the fine pointing mode can be met at all
possible spacecraft attitudes satisfying the attitude constraints of
Section 4.2.7. and for all possible spacecraft operational conditions.
