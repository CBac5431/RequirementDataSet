STHE-040
H/P
Fulfilment of all the functional performances (operational and nonoperational)
of the unit is mandatory for the complete acceptance test
range. Partial deviation from the performance requirements may be
accepted within the item qualification test margins, provided they do
not affect the interfaces to the S/C and they are reversible.
