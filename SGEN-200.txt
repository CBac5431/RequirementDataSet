For the Herschel telescope, the optical subsystem transmission
losses (as defined in AD2-1) shall be lower than 3.5% (TBC) over
the full 80 - 670 Î¼m range at the time of cryostat cover opening inorbit.
Appropriate and timely analyses and measurement
verifications shall be undertaken throughout the programme to
give maximum confidence that this performance will be achieved.
