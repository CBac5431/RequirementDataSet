SCMD-025
H/P
The structure shall withstand at element, subassembly, or complete
spacecraft level the following:
- the ultimate loads without rupture, collapse or permanent
deformations that impact the integrity of other parts or the system
performance.
- the yield loads, where applicable, without permanent deformation
or any plastic deformation resulting in performance degradation.
- the buckling loads without elastic buckling or collapse taking into
account a non perfection of the failing element, e.g. by knockdown
factors.
