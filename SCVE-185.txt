H/P
The spacecraft thermal sensors ( e.g. thermistors, thermo-couples )
shall be continuously monitored during the test and be used for the
assessment of the stabilisation. In addition, they shall be used for the
correlation. Additional measurement points shall be provided by test
thermal sensors , mainly for complementing the flight measurement
plan and monitoring local or general environmental data.
