SMPC-065
H/P
The subsystem shall provide dedicated heater outputs for thermally
critical units. These outputs shall be connected such that no other unit
nor subsystem must be active to energise these lines. The lines shall
act as additional redundancies and shall be controlled by independent
and dedicated thermostats.
