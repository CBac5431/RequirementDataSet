H
Once in orbit, the cryocover shall be opened by a fully redundant
mechanism(s) with adequate margins of safety against worst case
torques/forces. Only one in-orbit opening operation is foreseen and
such an opening shall be possible with any temperature of the
mechanism(s) from ambient down to operational temperature.
